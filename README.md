# AdaBoost Machine Learning Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) machine learning algorithm. AdaBoost is a powerful ensemble method that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong classifier, often used for classification tasks.

## Features

- Implements the AdaBoost algorithm from scratch (or using popular libraries like scikit-learn, as applicable)
- Supports binary classification
- Customizable base estimators (e.g., decision stumps)
- Easy to integrate with your data pipeline

## How It Works

AdaBoost works by sequentially training weak classifiers, where each new classifier focuses more on the instances that previous classifiers misclassified. The final prediction is a weighted vote of all weak classifiers.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-adaboost-repo.git
   cd your-adaboost-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the algorithm:**
   ```bash
   python adaboost_example.py
   ```

4. **Customize parameters** in `adaboost_example.py` for your dataset and requirements.

## Example

```python
from adaboost import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=4, random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train AdaBoost
model = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=50)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
